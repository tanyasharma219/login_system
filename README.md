Login to the docs
In your ReadMe docs project that you want to test this demo with, set the custom login page to this demo's page:

http://localhost/login_xenon/login.php

Then log out of ReadMe (if you're logged in), click login, and you should be redirected to the Demo Login page being run on your localhost by this demo server. Leave the example credentials, click Login, and you'll see you're logged in as test@example.com in your ReadMe docs project. Now you'll see the API explorer prepopulates each code example with an authentication header. (don't expect the API Explorer Try it out button to actually work, though, that would require a working API behind the docs, which is outside the scope of this demo).
